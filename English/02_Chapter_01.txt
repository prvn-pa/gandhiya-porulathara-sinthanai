## CHAPTER 1

### PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING GANDHIAN ECONOMY

There is no such thing as the principles of Economics of Gandhiji. With Gandhijieconomics is a part of a way of life. There are no governing principles as areapplied in the case of ordinary laws that have been enunciated in text books onEconomics. Only two life principles govern all Gandhiji's economic, social,political and other considerations, viz. Truth and Non-violence. Anything thatcannot be satisfactorily tested on these touch-stones, as it were, cannot beregarded as Gandhian. If a scheme of things leads to violence or necessitatesuntruth, then we may regard that as non-Gandhian.

Let us take these two principles and apply them in every walk of life and seewhere truth exists, where nonviolence could be generated. If at any time theseends cannot be achieved, such courses must be abandoned.

First, we shall consider the kinds of motives, after that the relationshipbetween the members of the human family, and lastly, the various types ofnatural resources. We shall then see how these things have to be correlated inour daily fife.

### MOTIVES

If we take the human family, we may divide it into five different groupsaccording to our approach. We can trace them in the ordinary life of evenanimals. For instances, take one that is most violent and cruel, viz. tiger. Howdoes it go about its economic life? How does the tiger find its food? It gets itsfood by killing animals. The tiger does not create, does not contribute anythingtowards production but it consumes without producing Here is Consumptionwithout production. Where does it live? It lives in caves, in natural holes and inrocks. The tiger is parasitic as far as its food is concerned. The tiger's methodof obtaining shelter is predatory.  Take the monkey. How does it get its food? By picking up fruits and leaves hereand there. It gets it by predation. The monkey does not kill the source of itsfood but takes what is available. These are two methods exemplified by thecase of the tiger, and the monkey respectively. There is consumption withoutproduction. Neither of them produces anything and they merely live on thestock that is readily available. In the final analysis, they are both equal butthere is a difference when it comes to the question of the amount of violenceinvolved. The tiger is much more violent than the monkey. The monkey doesnot destroy the source from where its food comes. The first one is parasitic andthe second one is predatory. Both are self-centered. They have no sense ofduty. They think only in terms of their hunger-selfishness and self-centerednessbased on rights.

Then we come to the third position, where there is a balancing of rights withduties. That is what may be called the "Enterprising stage”. You produce andyou consume. Look at the abode of the little birds in the house. They pick upwith their bills straw, sticks, cotton etc. and build their nests. The bird buildsits own nest, unlike the tiger which lives in the caves. It builds its nest wherecats cannot get at it, and it enjoys the shelter that has produced with greateffort and forethought. Her production and consumption. It exercises the rightof private property, for when some other bird comes, it will peck at it anddrive it away. Rights and duties are mixed up in it.

We have the fourth stage; the gregarious stage is that of the bee. When a beecollects honey, what does it do? It puts it in the hive. It does not say that aparticular single hole in the comb is its own. It collects for the benefit of thewhole colony. A bee, when it brings honey, puts it in the honey comb andleaves it to be used by the other bees also. It does not produce for its ownpersonal consumption but for general consumption. All the bees live togetheras one family. There is an excess of a sense of duty as against a feeling of right.

Production is greater than Consumption and the surplus is meant for others.

We come to the fifth stage. We mentioned the bird in its nest in the thirdstage. Supposing it has produced a baby. In the morning it goes out, picks up  whatever food, such as grains, is to be found and feeds its young with it. It doesnot say that it has the right to swallow what it has found. It takes it to the littlebaby bird and feeds it. Does it think that when the little one grows up, it wouldfeed the mother when old? Nothing of the sort. It gives without a thought ofany return. It is wholly motivated by a sense of duty. This is what may becalled Mother Economy or Service Economy.

These are the five types under which we may develop the idea of economicactivities, namely, parasitic, Predatory, enterprising, and gregarious and theservice stages. The principles connected with each one of them will differ. Inthe parasitic stage, it is all self-centered and does not think that the wealthcreated belongs to him personally because he himself has laboured. There is asense of oneness and a sense of working for a group.

Service Economy— a mother is the best instance of this. The mother works forthe child. She does not expect any return. Service is its own reward.

Similarly we may find these divisions in group life, in government, in nations,etc.

Group life based on destruction of life or the esuppression of the rights of otherpeople—which Imperialism is, is jungle economy. By this other countries aresubjugated and the mighty get something out of the weak. It is a parasiteeconomy.1. India had been subjected politically to Great Britain. This is an illustrationof Parasite economy.2. Economic subjugation of others—Financial penetration of America is agood instance of predatoryeconomy.4. Enterprise—The agricultural economy which had been practised in ourcountry in olden days is an instance of the enterprising economy. It is aself-sufficient economy.5. Gregarious economy—Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany may come under thiscategory to a large extent.  6. We do not have in history an instance of a stage of Service Economy, butGandhiji was working towards that stage.

These five stages can be found in our individual daily action also. It is easy tolaugh at others, but when we come to think of ourselves, we are sometimestigers, sometimes monkeys, sometimes this and sometimes that. When we eatuntidily, and throw out all sorts of things, we belong to the tiger stage. Weshould ask each night as to how many times during the day we have been atiger, etc., and if there is a growing tendency towards the mother economy, weare moving towards civilization. Otherwise, we are going towards the junglestage.

The analysis given is nothing very novel, because it is found in the Hindu orderof society. You have the Mlechchas, Shurdas, Vaishya's, Kshatriyas, andBrahmins. If your desire is to help your fellowmen, even though you may be aMlechha by birth, you belong to the Brahmin group- If you are born a Brahminand are doing Government service, for the fat salary you get you are in effect aMelchcha. These Melchchas are at the tiger stage. The Shurdas are predatory.

The Vaishyas, who deal justly, belong to the enterprizing stage. The Vaishya,who gives wrong weights and measures, belongs to the tiger economy. The millowners belong to the tiger economy. If we divide our society into these fivebroad stages, based on actions and not birth, it is possible for the Mlechcha tobe a Brahmin in the service of his fellowmen. Gandhiji's plan was to develophuman beings step by step from the Mlechcha plane onwards to the Brahminstage. The upward progress will be according to one's moral and physicaldevelopment. That is the purpose of all education. At the time when rightsdisappear and duties take their place, we reach the Brahmin or serviceeconomy.

### NATURAL RESOURCES

We then come to the question of the utilization of Natural Resources. In thecase of the use of these resources, again, as we move towards service economy  from parasitic economy the measure of violence will steadily decrease. That ishow non-violence could be promoted.

We may divide natural resources into two classes— one, which is never ending,like the flow of water in a river. When a bucket of water is taken out from ariver will the level of the river go down? Considered mathematically and byabsolute standards the level does go down, but generally speaking the answer isNo. Some more water comes to fill the depression created. When a little wateris drunk out of a glass of water, the level will go down. Why? In the first casethe supply is relatively unlimited, and in the second case the supply is limited.

These may be termed Current Economy and Reservoir Economy respectively.

The whole Gandhian Economy can now be gauged according to the possibilitiesof violence or non-violence that may be introduced by resorting to Reservoir orCurrent economy in our activities.

When goods are in short supply the competition for its possession will lead toviolence. Hence if our economic organization is such that more reliance isplaced on resources of reservoir economy, there will be more violence. Iron isin limited quantity. It comes under our reservoir economy. If we desire topromote non-violence in society, more percentage of wood, which belongs tocurrent economy, must be used and less of iron. Petrol falls into our reservoireconomy. As it becomes less, and less, its use leads to conflict. The increasingviolence in our society today is due to the nations running into reservoireconomy, abandoning current economy. As petrol so also coal, is of thereservoir economy. Horse, bullock and cow belong to current economy. WhenEngland was on the Horse Economy, they ploughed with horses, theytransported by the use of horses. Violence was much less in England then.

Before the Industrial Revolution set in, they used coal only for cookingpurposes. With the advent of steam power coal became the pivot of theeconomy of England, which passed then from Current Economy to ReservoirEconomy. Violence in England has been increasing for the last 150 years.

In India, the cow has been considered a sacred animal, because it is the centreof our economy. It has been, therefore, glorified into a sacred animal. Tractor  ploughing is reservoir economy. It is made of iron and steel, and petrol or crudeoil is needed to ply it. The instrument we use in producing goods will ultimatelylead to violence or non-violence according to the extent to which we utilisereservoir or current economy.

The Charkha or the spinning wheel belongs to the current economy; while thetextile mills belong to the reservoir economy.

Thermal electricity is altogether reservoir economy. Hydro-electricity is largelyreservoir economy, only the power of turning the wheel is water. The bulk ofthe expenditure on the hydro-electric schemes is in the generating equipmentwhich is, therefore, mainly of reservoir economy. Ultimately, therefore, by andlarge, the electric group may be classified as belonging to reservoir economy.

A mud-hut with thatches for the roof belongs to current economy. Buildings ofcement and concrete belong to the reservoir economy. Current economy ispermanent because it does not lead to competition which will result in violenceand destruction, while reservoir economy is not permanent.

The common plough is of current economy. There is no doubt a little iron in it.

We can use iron also but it should be done in the proportion in which iron isfound in nature. In the mud-huts, we may have iron nails. Our contention isonly that where there is an over-whelming element of reservoir economy, tothat extent violence in our society will be great.

The more we base our order on the current economy, the less will be theviolence. The greater will be the violence when we base our economy onreservoir economy.

### PRODUCT

More and more things are produced to supply our primary needs, less and lesswill be the violence. The more we produce luxuries, the greater will be theviolence that is generated. If you starve people and try to produce luxuryarticles, it will lead to violence. Production of a luxury like tobacco at the costof a primary need like cereals, will weigh the scales towards violence. The  complexion of the economic organization will indicate generally, whether thatorganization will generate violence or will bring about peace and prosperity tothe people. We want to see the principles which will guide us towards therealization of Nonviolence and Truth (the moral considerations we have takenfor granted in the Gandhian Economy) steadily pursued and adopted. Less ofluxuries and more of primary needs would mean more chances of nonviolence.

If we want to infuse non-violence and truth into our society, we have got toremember these principles and organize accordingly.

### METHODS OF PRODUCTION

There are two different methods of producing articles. We can produce them ineither one of those two methods. According to the method we choose, theprinciples used will be different. We shall consider production first andconsumption later. Supposing the mother is making something for her children.

How does she go about it? What are her objectives and how does her methoddiffer from any other way of preparing it? Assume that she wants to preparehalva. How will she do it? The mother who understands what she is doing, willprobably select the wheat and grind it herself to the necessary fineness andkeep the atta whole, without polishing it and taking out of it any of thenutritive elements contained in it. She will, in other words, preserve all thatthere is in that wheat. Then if she has a cow of her own, she will churn thecurd produced out of the milk and prepare her own butter and ghee. Grindingthe wheat is very difficult. Preparing ghee is troublesome. Why does she notpurchase Vanaspati or cheap ghee in the market? She is willing to take all thistrouble because her objective is the nutrition of her children: She is intenselyinterested in the welfare of her children. She considers any amount of labourwhich she takes fully compensated when she finds that her children get thebenefit of it all. It is out of a sense of duty and affection that she does all this.

If she is an intelligent woman, she will study dietetics and find out how thesethings should be prepared without destroying the food values in the  constituents. She has the satisfaction that the children have had the best ofwhat she can afford to give. This is production for use.

Halzua is also prepared by others; the mother has not got the monopoly. Theconfectioner too engages himself in this work. What is his objective? Hisobjective is no doubt to produce something; but his main objective is not theproduction of those articles, but to transfer the money that the customer hasgot into his own pocket, and he seeks the easiest method by which he couldeffect that transfer. For that he will do all sorts of things. The lesser the out-going the better it is for him. He finds out where he can get cheap wheat,perhaps worm-eaten wheat, mill-ground at the cheapest rate, where he can getthe cheapest kind of oil or so-called ghee or some adulterated stuff. If thehalzua does not smell well, he sprinkles some rose-water and adds somecolouring matter so that it is made to look attractive. All other smellsdisappear, as it were, in the over-whelming odour that comes from the stuff heputs in it. One who eats that halwa will suffer from diarrhoea. The confectionerdoes not bother about it. The doctor will perhaps have a share of thecustomer's money too. This is what is called industry or production forexchange.

Naturally work does not go without a reaction on the producer and hispersonality. In so far as one develops, one is developing by one's own actions.

By turning on the radio one will not learn music. One has got to sit up andpractice on the instruments until one's neighbours get tired! The muscles of thefingers and the nerves of he ears and eyes should be co-ordinated. It is thispractice that creates and develops a musician and not merely listening to aradio.

Every action has its own reaction, and these two methods of preparing halwahave their reaction. What is its reaction on the mother? Her intense study ofdietetics will give her a better understanding of the body and its requirementsand she does this for the love of her children and that makes her a betterwoman.  The confectioner wants to give as little as he could and take as mush aspossible. This is in other words robbery. The larger the margin of profit one isable to make, the more successful one is considered as a businessman or as anindustrialist. This carried to the logical extreme may lead to killing a man andtaking away the money he has and will bring a cent per cent return. This canvery well be done. This leads to gangsterism as a profession. This is thementality that is. developed by the confectioner preparing halwa. He developsgreed and irresponsibility. The reaction is thus one of creating parasites onsociety who indulge in robbing one another. When this is done on a nationalscale, we produce a world war. The Mithaiwala* economics creates falsestandards and violence, while the mother's method of production develops herlove and truthfulness, but entails hard work.

An industrialist produces for exchange but the mother produces for homeconsumption. Mother's work is based on the self-sufficient economy but whenwe work on an exchange economy, we are apt to act like the confectioner andfinally end up as gangsters.

### EXCHANGE AND TRADE

When goods that are in short supply enter the general marker there is likely tobe dissatisfaction which will lead finally to violence. True trade can only takeplace in surpluses.

Supposing there are about half a dozen laddus* and we give them to a boy. Hegoes on eating one after another. He gets a certain amount of satisfaction whenhe eats the first, and then the second, then the third and by the time he comesto take the fourth one, he feels a minus value. After that he is thirsty. At thisstage another boy appears with a glass of water. There are one or two moreladdus left and the first, boy, whose appetite for laddus is satisted, does notknow how to dispose of these. He says to the other boy. "Give me some waterand | will give you laddus.” If they then exchange, both will profit. The thirstyboy gets the water and the hungry one gets the laddus. This is an example of  exchange in surpluses which is mutually beneficial. For human satisfaction mustbe mutual to be real.

On the other hand, if there is one pot of water and if all people want to drink,it will not be sufficient and there will be a fight for it, and in the scramble allthe water may be spilt over and none will be satisfied.

Money or Barter—from time immemorial tokens have been used in exchangingcommodities. But now, with an immense increase in wants, money is being usedto conceal values. It does not report true human values. If we give twelveannas for a seer of milk there is no guarantee that the seller will be able to getan equivalent of one seer of milk in nutrition. He may be tempted to give hischildren tea instead. He may deprive the calf of its due share of its mother'smilk and sell all he gets without nourishing his own children. For this state ofaffairs a high price in money is often responsible. It is an inducement to partwith a more valuable article for a less or even a harmful substitute. Hencemoney deceives and creates violence.

It is through the inducement of money that land is drawn away from foodarticles into cultivating commercially profitable crops like tobacco. Thecommon people are not conscious of the damage done through the medium ofmoney.

Even trade is directed to luxuries from providing the prime necessities of manthrough the use of money. Rich people can afford to spend money freely and sothe merchants and manufacturers organize to cater to their demands ratherthan supply the needs of the poor, as the latter business has little chance ofprofit in it. Rice cultivation will barely meet the cost of production while toiletsoap manufacture will yield attractive dividends. From human standards this isan anti-social direction of economic activity made possible by the agency ofmoney. These and such evils are both violent and dishonest. Barter or exchangein commodities will minimize such danger to a great extent.  CO-OPERATIONHere we do not refer to the legal organization of cooperation but to humanrelationship. Co-operation between people makes for mutual wellbeing. Everymember of society depends for his own happiness on the wellbeing of everyother. If the potter makes pots and the shoe-maker uses aluminium vesselswhere will the potter get his customer to enable him to buy the shoes made byhis fellow villager, the shoemaker? The potter in his turn may, if he can affordit, patronize machine- made shoes. After a while both the artisans will becomeextinct. Our course of daily routine must be calculated to bring about mutualgood. Such co-operation alone will save our villagers from economic distress.

Economic co-operation weaves the village into a pattern which builds up unitywithout this organic unity community life will disintegrate, creating divisionsand dissension’s as we find them today. Such scattered communities inviteoutsiders to exploit the situation. To work towards such unity we need self-discipline and self- control. If a village uses articles imported from America,the warp is in the village but the woof is in U.

S.A. This cannot form a patterncalculated to protect the village which will be destined to form part ofeconomic America ultimately. No army, navy or air force can prevent thishappening. A proper economic co-operative unity is the core of non-violentdefense against foreign aggression. It will alone supply the cohesive force tobring solidarity to a nation and thus contribute towards world peace. This is thebasic idea underlying self-sufficiency programme.

### STANDARD OF LIVING

For the reasons already discussed it becomes imperative that the daily life ofthe people should be so regulated as to enable them to express theirpersonality. What we eat, wherewith we are clothed and what manner of liveswe lead, all have a bearing, not only on our own lives, but also, On the futureof mankind. Just as each person expresses himself through the scale of valueshe uses so also his manner Of living will expresses his personality. To do this  there should be norms for all people to adhere to, and these norms orstandards must be arrived at from purely objective considerations calculated toafford every person that opportunity in full measure that is needed to developall faculties and thereby his personality. The suggested norm of standard shouldrelate not only to physical and material needs but also to all those innumerableitems that go to enrich and ennoble life and raise it above the level of mereexistence. Of course, it will naturally deal with food that is required tomaintain a level of human performance with adequate medical aid, withclothing that will not only cover nakedness but will also afford room for anexpression of art and beauty, with education which will widen and brighten lifewhile developing the inherent faculties with congenial work that will open upopportunities, for the creative propensities of man and with all such otheraccessory facilities that will help in the progress both of the individual and thegroup.

Taking the example of dining, whether the meal is taken in Western style or inIndian style there is little difference intuitively. The Indian method of eatinghas advantages of cheapness combined with cleanliness and affords free scopefor one's ideas of art in serving. What s more colourful than a meal served on agreen fresh leaf? The creamy rice or chapattis with yellow dhal, white redchutneys- brown pickles, multicoloured salad of fresh vegetables, redtomatoes, etc., make a pleasing sight to start with; when the meal is over andthe leaves have been removed, only the floor remains to be washed out. Thediners themselves, who eat with their fingers, invariably wash their teeth andrinse their mouths also after meals, which is a most desirable and hygienichabit. But those who use forks and spoons have abandoned this wholesomecustom. The farthest they may go in this direction is to dip their finger tipsdaintily in a finger bowl of water and after moistening their lips wipe them offwith a napkin! Wherein lies the superiority of higher quality of the mostcomplicated Western style? The complex manner of life increases expensewithout any corresponding benefit in cleanliness or art. Therefore, thedistinction is more accurately made by calling the Western method ‘complex’and ours 'simple’, rather than 'high’ and ‘low’ respectively.  In America home life is being rapidly broken up by false ideas of living beingdisseminated. A couple may live in a flat of one or two rooms with ‘laboursaving devices'. The husband will go to work in the morning and so will thewife. Each will have a snack breakfast on the way in some cafeteria, andperhaps, lunch at a factory refreshment bar or grill, and the two will meet inthe evening and have their supper in a restaurant and, if their combinedincome is big enough to sport a car, will go for a drive and visit a cinema andreturn to their rooms to listen into the radio. There is no house-keeping,cooking or other attributes of the home. They will not care to have the botherof having children nor can their 'high' standard of living allow of it. These arethey who are slaving away for the manufacturers who set the 'high’ standard soas to have 'hands’ readily available for the factories.

The accepted standard of living, besides providing the opportunity for thedevelopment of one's faculties and laying out the method of expressing one'spersonality, should also form a link between the various members of societywhereby the better equipped help the less fortunately placed ones.

In such a manner, everyone of our requirements should be so linked up withlocal production and the life of the people around us as to form a solid well-knit economy. Only then will it lead to permanent, as it will promote healthygrowth without destruction by violence.

Frequently, the standard of life is described in terms of money and materialswithout any reference to the lives of those around us. Such standards areartificial and so are unstable and being super imposed and superficial cannotbe permanent having no root in the very life of the people. If we increaseproductivity of the masses and direct consumption so as to afford a ready localmarket, the standard of living of the people will automatically rise. Such anatural formation of a standard will proclaim the culture and genius of thepeople, and win be permanent being rooted in the life of the people.
