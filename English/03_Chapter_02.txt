## CHAPTER 2

### AGRARIAN ECONOMY AND RURAL RECONSTRUCTION

A nation cannot be independent unless it develops self-sufficiency in its primaryneeds—food, clothing and shelter. Our Agrarian Economy is one which helps usto stand on our own legs, ours has always been an agricultural country and allsuch industries as existed have been concentrated round agriculture.

### INDUSTRY OR OCCUPATION

The American method of producing grains makes agriculture an industry asdistinct from an occupation. We need to make that distinction clear because agreat many of the differences that arise and the methods that are used and theprinciples followed come out of that distinction.

An industry is not concerned with the question whether people are starving inIndia or in any part of the world, its sole concern is to maintain high prices.

Human considerations do not prevail at all. All that is needed is keep down thesupply so that the demand will put-up the prices.

In U.S.A. there is a plentiful supply of land and so they produce for exchangeusing all the wasteful and selfish methods of the Mithaiwala.

### MANURES

Ours is an ancient land with a teeming population. Land requires time torecuperate between crops. The more we extract from the land the longer ittakes to regain its fertility. Our methods of agriculture have, through theexperience Of centuries, reached a stage where production is balanced with itsrecuperative power. If we use the Mithaiwala methods and attempt to exploitthe land to the fullest extent by stimulating it, we shall be exhausting itsfertility faster than its ability to regain itself and finally we shall be turninggood cultivable soil into barren deserts. This is the danger facing our country  should it decide to take to the American methods of cultivation. It is better forus to be content with a smaller crop while remaining within the range ofrecovery of soil fertility. The extent of production is not the only concern butthe balance between production and continued use of land available is also animportant factor. We shall see how the details of the processes involved in thetwo methods lead to widely differing results,Artificial fertilization, according to many scientists, exhausts the soil. Thereare such things as earth worms. These earth worms do a great deal of theagricultural work we need. Our ploughing, weeding, etc., are not so veryimportant operations as the work done by the earth worm. These worms eatthe humus-vegetable matter—in the soil and they turn it inside themselves intoan assimilable type of manure which they throw out. In the act of boring intothe earth, they enable air and water to get through, so that the soil is enrichedby taking certain things from the air and water. Therefore, the earth worms arereally fertilizing the soil, and helping the recuperative process.

But when we use artificial fertilizers, we are not giving these worms thenecessary vegetable matter from which they can get their food. When we go ongiving them chemical fertilizers, they die out as they cannot live on chemicals.

Earth worms require farm yard manure to thrive. Such manure is like staplefood for the soil. While using fertilizers, first, we plough a little bit of land.

When that is exhausted, plough a little deeper, till at last we find that the soilgets caked like a rock as there are no earth worms to loosen the soil. Youcannot use that land afterwards in any way. In India with a limited extent ofland we cannot use this method.

Chemical fertilizers are a drug as distinguished from food. Drugs may benecessary in certain cases. Supposing a fellow is drunk with toddy and hedances, we would not call that energy production. It is an excitement of thenervous system. He will be exhausting himself after a little exertion. The nextmoment he will be rolling in the gutters. That is what happens to the soil whenfertilizers are used. They have a place, of course. If one is ill, doctors comeand give some suitable injection. They give it in very small doses according to  the needs of the case. They examine the patient, particularly the heart, andsee how much the patient could stand and then administer according to theindications in the particular case. The doctors may give quinine for Malaria.

Suppose a patient thinks—"the doctor gives me quinine for Malaria. He wantsme to take 2 or 3 or 5 grains a day. By taking in a lump | must get bettersooner. So | must take a Laddu of quinine and take it “What will happen? Hewill be cured of Malaria, but the germs will die along with him. We can prepareLaddu of wheat and eat it according to the capacity of our digestion, and weshall be the better for it.

Thus fertilizers must be used as medicine and not as staple food and they canonly be used after a careful soil analysis and in prescribed doses for particularpieces of land.

Where a person is looking at the enrichment of the soil from the industrialpoint of view, he does not care two straws for the soil's ultimate condition.

What he wants is big crops and large crops in quantity. He goes on fertilizingand getting crops for a few years. Afterwards he will have to go without them.

In an industry this method can be allowed. In America they have beenwastefully utilizing petrol during the last two wars. At one time they thoughtthat they had got an inexhaustible store of petrol. Today they want other landswhere petrol could be had. This kind of wasteful exhaustion brings one to astate where one wants to impinge on other's property. This greed is a fruitfulsource of violence.

Artificial fertilization is not a thing that India can stand. If it has got to beadministered, side by side with it, you must have chemical analysis of the soilall over the country, and it should be found out where it is necessary and whatis necessary.

There are some fields where Jowar and other things are cultivated. Some Jowarplants may be 10 feet or 12 feet high, while others are stunted. What does itmean? It means that some soils are very good and others are extremely poor.

That poor soil will have to be analysed and given what is necessary. We havenot got in India doctors even for human beings, let alone doctors for soil  analysis. Therefore, it is absurd in India to use artificial fertilization. In Biharand Travancore there are artificial fertilizer factories. The industrialists, likethe Mithaizvala, want to have the money transferred from the pockets of poorriots into their own pockets. Let us not fall a victim to these temptations.

If we analyse these two methods of cultivation the former comes under themother's method of preparing halwa. We have to look after the land just as themother wants to look after the child. The method of dealing with land, oragrarian economy, will have to be shaped according to whether we wish tostimulate the soil and exploit it or feed and use it.

The method of dealing with the land has also several consequences. The "shortterm methods are wasteful. The American cultivation is an industry and not anoccupation as it is in India. The natural development of the farmer, therefore,and his attitude towards his fellowmen differs. The industrialist never botherswho his customers are. The industrialist does not get into touch with theconsumer. The mother's method will have to be centered round the person andhis needs. Even when there is food shortage in India, they are going onincreasing area Virginia tobacco. It is the Mithaizvala method. They areproducing not for food but for money. The same is true of many other things inour economy. It is necessary to decide what we are going to do. Are we goingto have self sufficiency? Or are we going to make a few rich? Erection of a dammeans millions of acres will be brought under cultivation and crores of rupeeswill be spent and as a result thereof electricity will be generated. What is themain purpose? The purpose is to sell electricity. Industrialists are interestedonly in building up the dam. The electricity talk is the salesman’s talk and theirrigation of millions of acres is also a salesman's talk. If it is wanted is toirrigate large areas, what is required is to spend small amounts say Rs. 500/- ateach place where erosion is going on or wells are wanted. The villagers willtake care of the rest. The expenses will not be-so great then. The Governmentcan give the villagers materials. This will be a very good method of tackling theproblem with the co-operation of the people. It will develop people intolooking after the Governmental functions also.  There is danger in all such projects. Electricity is not an unqualified blessing.

In South Arcot district electricity generated from the Mettur project was madeavailable. They wanted electric pumps to be used for pumping out water fromwells and tanks. The place was getting absolutely barren. The villagers werecutting down cashew nut trees. They were quite good trees and not diseasedones. On enquiry the people said that they had nothing to eat and they werecutting the trees and making them into charcoal and selling them and getting alivelihood that way. They said that since the giant electric poles had come theycould not cultivate their lands. They said electricity was used for pumping outwater. "They sold electric pumps and all those who had money bought them.

We have no money to buy them. The people who are already rich purchasedthem. They pump the water out; the result is that all the wells that are 30 feetor so deep become dry and the poor people are without water. We used to takeout water with the use of bullocks. Even our tanks have gone dry.” The plotswhich looked like land were originally tanks. Formerly when there was noelectric pump, the rich were also cultivating Towar etc. Now they haveconverted the land into garden crops. They are growing all kinds of fruits. Whathappens to these fruits? They go to Bombay, Bangalore, Madras and Calcutta.

So the water is being transferred to Bombay, Bangalore, Madras and Calcuttabecause of the electric pump and the poor people's food has been cut out. Tosave themselves from starving they are cutting down trees and making charcoaland trying to keep body and soul together for a while. Now we see where theMithaiwala economics leads us to! People were cheated and it has resultedultimately in ruining the poor people. We see how this seemingly good schemeruins the people. Therefore, such scheme must be passed by the local peopleand they must understand and analyse the consequences of these things andfind out where they will lead them to and take care that they do not harmthem in any way. We must not be carried away by saying that in America theyare doing this and that, in New Zealand they are doing that, etc., Our methodshave to be fitted to the conditions prevailing in our own land.  AGRICULTURAL PRICESThe prices of agrarian products are not fixed by the producer at present.

Because of conditions over which the farmer has no control, since he has todepend on the monsoon, he has no work for some months in the year. But wehave to provide for his living. We are not including this in the cost ofproduction. Suppose a man manufactures a bicycle. He leaves it in his ShowRoom for 6 months. When he sells it, he calculates the rent charges, puts a bigmargin of profit on it, etc., and sells it at a price based on such a calculation.

All this is charged to the cost of production. So also should be the calculation inthe case of the farmer. The so-called Economists sit down and being to putdown the prices of various things like iron, kerosene, clothing, etc., preparingsome kind of jugglery and they call that a ‘price index'. With this they calculatewhat the prices of agricultural products should be and fix the prices with noreference to actual costs. This is done by the Government and the consumerwithout consulting the producer in the matter. Thus the Government and theconsumer together rob the rural population. That is what is happening. Theyactually rob it in this sense that it has no relationship to the actual productioneither. This thing had been done in the British regime and the same thing isgoing on today.

To protect the farmers from exploitation and ensure their needs being met wehave a scheme called ‘balanced cultivation.’ In order to give the people abalanced diet we calculate how much land is necessary for the population of 10to 15 villages. It will give us a gross idea. Then a survey of the land is made tofind out how many acres can grow wheat and how many acres vegetables andmillets and so on and thus determine how to balance the cultivation. If we areshort in certain things, we may be surplus in certain other things. Suchsurpluses are exchanged for goods in short supply. If there is exchange insurplus there will be no need for any violence or injustice. Violence andinjustice arise out of exchanges which go below the level of self-sufficiency.

This can only be done if we look upon Agriculture us an occupation. If we wantto develop the whole region economically, we require an intelligent use of  land, and cultivation should follow our requirement and exchange what surpluswe have for other things that we require. That is as regards utilization of theland.

### OWNERSHIP

All ownership in land is sinful. Today especially in U.P., Bihar and Bengal wehave a huge Zamindari system which is nothing less than misappropriation ofpublic property. How much of the sunlight belongs to a man? We cannot haveownership in sunlight, air, water, etc. In the same way there can be no morepossession in land, which is God-given social property. It is to be used for thebenefit of the whole society. Just as sunlight, water, air, etc., belong to thecommunity, so also land must belong to the community. It will be let outaccording to one's capacity to use it for social benefit. The ownership in landmust belong to the community. That was our old system also. The villagecommunity owned the land and it was given out to different families forcultivation.

The cultivator who cultivates the land must have full benefit of the yield fromthe land he cultivates and only the surplus must be distributed amongst the restof the people. When this system prevails we shall have distributive justice.

Distribution will have to be according to the needs of the people. We must banprivate exchange of goods except through a controlled agency like the Co-operative Society.

The Co-operative Societies should be the distributing media and not theindividual. The surplus should be handled through some medium where it canbe controlled. In this way production could be equitably distributed.

### LABOUR

Today there is an amount of serfdom among agricultural labour anddehumanizing practices are going on all over the country. We cannot allow thisif our agrarian economy is to follow a rational basis. In Gorakhpur there are  Gobris. What is this Gobris system The Zamindar gives the labourer the right tocollect the cow dung. He washes it and takes the undigested grain of wheatfrom the animal's excreta and that wheat is used for food! It is considered aprivilege for these poor fellows and it is a part of their wages. This is howagricultural labour is being degraded in various ways.

In South India people take a loan of 10 or 15 rupees and work for generationsunder a landlord. In Malabar there are certain types of agricultural labourerswho are used as cattle. The owners send their men for labour in other's fieldsand take the hire. The wages do not go to the people who work but to thelandlords. The same kind of system is prevailing in Gujarat. All these evilpractices are results of making land private property.

The various methods by which land is being exploited today, whether it be inIndia or in the West, have been based on principles that apply to industry. Theprices, the methods used, etc., are all derogatory to human development. Wemust employ the mother's type of approach to these problems, and nobodyshould be able to exploit another for his own advantage. If we keep that inmind we shall develop a satisfactory system.

The feeling has to be created that our agricultural colleges are responsible tokeep the land free from famines. If they do not do that, there is nojustification for maintaining all these colleges. Up till now they have developeddifferent kinds of sugarcanes so that the mills could regularly get supplies everymonth and could work steadily. They have brought about, cross-breedingbetween American cotton and Indian cotton, etc. But the primary need of thevillager is not looked after.

Rights and investments: Land tenures in our country vary from province toprovince and from person to person. Each holder holds under special contracts,Cultivable land is looked upon as investment. This lessens the amount of returnto the workers. In a society every man should be a producer. But people nowhold land as investment only. This is a parasitic economy.

In land the third party right might arise. In this case as in mills the socialinterests are comparatively little. In cultivable fields it is not so. If rice fields  are converted into sugarcane fields the individual interests and the third partyinterest suffer resulting in food shortage.

In addition to landlords there are innumerable intermediaries. There should beno such intermediaries. There should be no owning of land except by those whoactually plough land. The holding of land for exchange produces poverty andlabour troubles.

Social effects: Fear of unemployment induces the scourer to act according tothe wishes of the master, sic human privileges have not yet been understood bye People. Agriculture must be construed a social ervice. Grants must be givento agriculturists for improvements. Such grants must be attached to the land,not to the man who holds it. Society should take into consideration that theland is for the use of the people at large. Loans should be granted on the basisof the needs of the land and not on the credit worthiness of the tiller.

### DIVISION OF PRODUCE

Today the whole of the Government organization is based on revenueconsideration. Governments are getting whatever they can get; they are notgetting what the people can bear. Revenue has to be paid in money by thefarmer. It means that the farmer who gets his income by way of crops will haveto convert it into money at harvest time when prices are low. Governments donot think of the difficulties the poor agriculturists are put to. Payment in kindwill be beneficial to the people. Agricultural labour is also paid in kind. IndeedGovernment may have some difficulties to get kist* in kind. Their difficultiesshould not be the deciding factor. By creation of Multipurpose Co-operativeSocieties the collection of revenue in the villages can be made through themand redistributed according to Government needs in the same villages, Socialjustice will be brought about by receiving revenue in kind.
