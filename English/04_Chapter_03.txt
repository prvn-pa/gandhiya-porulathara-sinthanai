## CHAPTER 3

### AGRO AND VILLAGE INDUSTRIES

There is a confusion of thought, right from the Government of Indiadownwards, in regard to the terms 'Village Industry’, 'Cottage Industry’ and'Home Industry’. These terms are used more or less loosely. There are points ofdifference between village industry, cottage industry and home industry.

In a 'village industry’, production, distribution and consumption are more or lesswithin the village. The potter makes pots not for sale in England, but for use inthe village. His consumer is his next-door neighbour. The number of things heproduces are produced distributed and consumed in the local area. We call thisa village industry."Cottage Industry” only refers to the method of production. In village industrieswe may have a large number of workers but still it will remain a villageindustry. We have in Sanganer and Kanpur the paper industry. A number ofpeople may be working, but it is a village industry. Take for instance sandal-wood and ivory carving. Here the production is in the cottage. The consumptionmay be anywhere in Paris, London or New York. Often cottage industries lendthemselves to exploitation. Their main purpose may be to sell the articlesabroad and get foreign exchange. What does it signify? The cottages are madeto work for the consumption of consumers anywhere. Ivory and sandal- Woodcarving may be sold outside to get dollars. Who wants dollars? It is the bigcapitalists who want dollars for heavy machinery and equipment of that nature.

It is one means of diverting the income that should be spent in the village toserve the purposes of capitalists. In a cottage industry distribution andconsumption may be on a worldwide basis.'Home Industries’ are carried on by home makers, who are generally women, fortheir home purposes. Embroidery work and a certain amount of knitting andneedle work, preserves like jam, pickle and papads, etc. Such maybe termed  home industries.

### PURPOSE

In village industries there is possibility of human development for the workerhimself. It places him on his merit. He has to be resourceful and, therefore, hedevelops; but in large scale industries very often initiative is destroyed. Westudy the consumer. We look after the customers' convenience. What are wereally doing? Ultimately we are really destroying the little ingenuity that maybe left in every one of us. Cigarette tins have inside them little card boardslips. When the lid is opened and the slip is pulled up, the first cigarette comesout and thus the packing is loosened. Because of that, smokers will purchasethat particular brand. We see large advertisements of self-winding wristwatches. Men have got so demoralized that they have not got the energy towind the watches! Some maker of self-winding watches is advertising that whenyou shake your hand this way or that, the watch automatically gets wound!A great many things are supposed to be made for convenience, but ultimatelythey are destroying their source fullness of the consumer and encouraginglaziness. The more the manufactures study consumers' convenience, the morethe latter become lazy. This is done to enslave the consumer. Ultimately, itmeans that a lot of our energy is diverted to various other things, on which weneed not spend it. Take for instance shaving. Before the safety-razor came, theold type of open razor made in Hamburg or England was sold for Rs. 3/8/-. Itcould last for over forty years. We can calculate how many shaves it can givefor Rs. 3/8/-. Such razors are now known as ‘cut-throat razors'. Because of thename, nobody wants to purchase such now. These are all tricks of the trade tocapture the consumer and keep him going. To sharpen the safety-razor blade,they give a definitely shaped piece of glass on which it can be sharpened. Witha little more resourcefulness only a bottle may be made to serve the purpose.

These sharpeners are sold and lazy minded men fall into the trap set for them.

The more they use these devices the more lazy they become. Business todayruns on lines calculated to make man more and more lazy. They are called  labour-saving devices. They really mean more labour for the person who istaking advantage of it.

In England they used to have a day in the week when the poor women of thelocality would come and beat the carpet of the well-to-do, clean it, and bepaid 18 d. per hour for the work; that used to go towards their living expenses.

Later, labour-saving devices came with vacuum cleaning. As a result these oldwomen, who are now displaced, do not get the 18 d. per hour for that part ofthe work, but the labour of vacuum cleaning has been shifted to the shouldersof the householder. It is all topsy-turvy.

When we plead village industries, it is not primarily for making work for otherpeople but as a means of self- expression. It helps one to grow. If it does not doit, it is not useful. The artisan's self-expression must be the same as that of theartist. The artist paints on a canvas say worth Rs. 5/- and uses paint worth Rs.5/-. Altogether he spends Rs. 10/r. But the painting may sell for hundreds oreven thousands of rupees. Why? It is for the personality of that artist which isprojected into his work. On the other hand take lithograph. On all -mill clothsbeautiful pictures of Saraswati and Lakshmi are to be seen. We can producesuch pictures on a large scale, but there is no personality, and the artist is notrepresented there. The real art comes where we project ourselves in certainthings, and cottage industries give us that opportunity, and every good cottageindustry worker takes an interest in the work he does himself.

The Khadi programme was directed to bringing about a certain amount of non-violence and truth in our own lives. Originally, as we have noted already,England was an animal-centered economy and horses provided the motiveforce. Then steam took the place. They invented weaving mills and spinningmills run by steam, and began to produce articles in a large measure, and,therefore, it was necessary to produce more cotton for the textile mills. At thattime India -was sending out beautiful Dacca muslins and other cotton fabrics toLondon. England imposed protective duties. Round about Manchester cottondoes not grow. Between the short staple cotton and the long staple cotton,there is a great difference. For hand spinning, short staple cotton, as is grown  in India, will do. The machine needs long staple cotton because of the highspeed at which the spindle rotates. The strength of the mill cloth dependslargely on the twist. As Manchester expended she wanted to have more andmore cotton. The Southern States of America, it was thought, would producethe needed quality and quantity of cotton. Many of the settlers there were ofBritish origin. Britain got them to cultivate the long staple cotton. TheBritishers are not fond of working in the hot sun, especially in tropical climates.

In the southern states of America the climatic conditions are not very good, butare much the same as are found in the northern parts of India. Hence, they hadto get slave labour for field work. That gave an impetus for the Negro slavetrade. When we use American cotton we see how we would become a party tothat slavery, which is an immoral thing. This went on merrily for some time tillabout the middle of the last century when Abraham Lincoln raised his voiceagainst slave trade. The Southern States said that they would not forego slavelabour as their standards of living would go down, and that they were lookingafter the slaves very well and all that kind of arguments that we see now in thetrusteeship idea. War was declared between the Northern States and theSouthern States. The cotton had been hitherto transported over to Manchesterby the Northern States. Now they refused to do so. Cotton export toManchester was stopped. Manchester had spent lakhs of rupees on themachinery. They thought that cotton should be produced somewhere else. TheNorthern parts of the Punjab were on the same latitude as of the SouthernStates’ of America. So they thought that such cotton could be produced in Indiaalso. By this time the British had got hold of the political power from the EastIndia Company. They began to carry on researches in cotton. That was thegenesis of the establishment of the Agricultural Colleges in India under thepretext of developing India. They carried on crores of rupees worth ofexperiments. Who paid for these researches? India bore the expenses andManchester got the benefit of the researches.

When long staple cotton was produced in the Punjab, it had to be sent toManchester. Then the Railways were developed again under the plea of  developing India. Who benefited by the railways? The Manchester people didwithout paying the cost.

Cotton had to be carried to Liverpool, Manchester, etc. They sent it roundCeylon, through the Red Sea and the Mediterranean route, etc. It called forpolicing the high ways. How did they do it? By having naval bases inTrincomalee in Ceylon, Aden in the Red Sea and Port said in the Mediterraneanetc. All these were fortified. Who paid for these? Not the Manchester millowner but the general taxpayer.

Under the circumstances will the product be cheaper? Undoubtedly, becausethe research expenses transport, etc., were borne by the Indian tax-payer andto a certain extent by the British tax-payer. To the producer it will be cheapbecause of the costs borne by somebody else. That was why mill-made cloth iseven today cheaper than Khadi. But there is dishonesty in it, In the whole ofthis history there is violence and untruth. It was nothing else but a nationalrobbery. Therefore, Gandhiji held that even if we had to go naked. We oughtnot to touch such goods. If we benefited by such economy we became partiesto the robbery.

There is a moral force behind this movement towards village industry. We canunderstand why combined with the political programme, this Khadi base gaveus a very good opportunity for the national movement and that was the reasonwhy Gandhiji started with Khadi as the chief item of the programme. "Ply theCharkha and win Swaraj”. What does it mean? It means ultimately that weunderstand the implications of that wheel, the Charkha. The progress fromuntruth to truth, the movement from violence to non-violence, must be felt byus.

Because of that the Manchester cloth must have in it certain moral or morecorrectly immoral values which cannot be computed in terms of money. Wereferred to the naval bases, and also the army and the navy. The army and thenavy cost no doubt a great deal; but more than that we have the cost which isnot computable in terms of money. The human lives lost, the blood that hasbeen shed to keep the places clear and safe for purposes of trade—these cannot  be computed. Therefore, the Manchester cloth was dipped in human blood! Wedon't have the spiritual vision to see the blood in the cloth and think it is white.

But to Gandhiji it was red with the marks of human blood. All foreign trade isultimately based on this type of violence.

If we use for everyday consumption the methods of large-scale production westand in danger of being parties to immoral practices. The more and more wedecentralize, the more and more we get into methods which are morally andspiritually on a higher plane. If food, clothing and shelter are needed all theseshould be provided by people who are working through decentralized units. Toa certain extent, it sterilises the robbery, the violence, and to that extent it isgood for the growth of the cultural life of the country. That is the place villageindustries have to fill in the nation.

That does not rule out large-scale industries at all. But knowing the dangers, toget over the evil, we sterilise it by taking away the profit motive, substitutingfor it only the service motive. We draw a line, what should be manufactured bythis method and what should be manufactured by other methods. We removethe chances of the wealthier or the more talented people exploiting themasses, and that is what we need. Decentralised industries have a definiteplace to play in our country, on a greater scale than large-scale industries. Weshould keep large-scale industries under definite control because they are notconducive to the growth of Swaraj, namely, the welfare of the general publicbeing represented in the councils of the nation.

### DEMOCRACY

In large-scale industries this is not possible. Persons at the top are in a positionto control or dictate to the four thousand or five thousand people—the labourforce—their method of living. For example, Tata nagar is in itself an empire. Noindividual has a right to rule over 4,000 to 5,000 men. Large-scale industriesare highly undemocratic while village industries develop democracy to agreater extent. Decentralised industry will develop the independence of theman and he will be able to keep his head erect. It ought to play a very  important part in the national life, preparing the people for democracy. Large-scale industries will politically lead to dictatorship. Even the so-calleddemocratic countries like America, Russia etc., became actual dictators underthe stress of war. Wherever a country uses centralized industries for producingthings which are necessary, ultimately it will end up in dictatorship. Democracywill be there only in form to mislead the people. There is hardly any differencebetween Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler or Mussolini. One is as good, or asbad, as the other. They were all dictators, because their countries had taken tothe same method of centralised production. It follows naturally that peopleworking in centralised industries get used to regimentation. This regimentationis not conducive to the growth of democracy. The fuller development of themoral and spiritual elements in man also call for a method of organizationthrough village or decentralised industries. Politically village industries providethe conditions for the development of democracy. To make use of villageindustries is not really going back to savagery unless democracy is savagery, butleads to civilization and culture, bringing out man's dignity and hisindependence and taking him out of the slavery of his own fellow men.

Today many of us are slaves financially. These financial difficulties are reallymill-stones that are put round our necks by the people at the top. If we developourselves on the basis of individual farming or individual village industry, wecan be independent. The higher the so-called standard of living, the stronger isthe tightening of the rope of subservience round us. We shall not have themoral strength to stand up for principles. High standard of living brings us tothis. The larger and larger the unit, the greater becomes our slavery. If wewant to have the moral political and spiritual problems solved, the only way isto be independent in our economic activity and we must resort to methods ofproduction which will bring about such a state of affairs.
