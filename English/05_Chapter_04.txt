## CHAPTER 4

### INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY

There is a false notion that industrialization is an easy means for any country'sadvancement. We must always learn from history. History is an unmistakablerecord of past events. As the saying goes "history repeats itself". If we take thesame steps we shall land ourselves in the same predicament. When early in thecentury in the great war between Russia and Japan, the later won, there wasrejoicing that an oriental nation had come up to the top. Within our ownlifetime we have seen Japan disappearing from the face of the earth as a bigpower. Why? Industrialization has not saved it. It has not saved any country. Atthe present moment, America appears to be at the top. There .

Is no knowing when she will also go under Violence creates unstable equilibrium. We cannotdepend on it. The next moment somebody else becomes more violent and theerstwhile lords of the earth disappear. The idea that large-scale industries willsave us is wrong. Industrialization is only indispensable if the country's economyis based on violence and is not calculated to meet its daily requirements. In ourcountry it is absolutely wasteful. It is far too expensive for us to indulge in it.

To equip the Army, or Navy or Air Force, industrialization is needed. Theycannot do without them. If we want non-violence, large-scale industries areuneconomical for producing consumption goods only.

### EFFICIENCY

For instance, one of the things that we use largely is paper. We can make paperby hand as well as by machinery. Which is the most economical method ofdoing it from the point of view of the best utilization of natural resources?Supposing we make paper from bamboos. What do the mill paper makers do?They have hundreds of acres of bamboos grown and they cut the tenderbamboo. They put it in the mill and the paper is delivered at the other end.

That is their method of doing it. It necessitates the cultivation of bamboo like  the cultivation of sugarcane. The mill method of production is similar to themithaiwala's method.

How do we produce it by hand? We don't have any forest cultivated forhandmade paper out of bamboo. We go round and collect broken bamboobaskets, old mats, etc- out of waste heaps. It is frequently from rotten thingsthat handmade paper is made.

Take the utilization point of view. Bamboo is produced from the earth. In thecase of the mill, it goes direct from the cultivated soil and comes out as paper.

In the case of the handmade paper we do not cultivate bamboo. It is grownwild in the jungle. These bamboos are brought and baskets, etc. are made outof them. They are used and they last for five to ten years. We have the use ofthe bamboo for all these years. When it gets rotten, it is thrown away. After itis thrown away, we convert it into paper. Which is the better utilization ofresources of these two methods? The second method naturally, because we getseveral years use out of the bamboo and when it becomes useless, we make useof it again for paper. We notice how wasteful it is to make paper by the firstmethod.

In Norway and Sweden they have vast forests and they make paper from woodpulp. In our country this is machinery. Which is the most economical method ofdoing it from the point of view of the best utilization of natural resources?Supposing we make paper from bamboos. What do the mill paper makers do?They have hundreds of acres of bamboos grown and they cut the tender bamoo.

They put it in the mill and the paper is delivered at the other end. That is theirmethod of doing it. It necessitates the cultivation of bamboo like thecultivation of sugarcane. The mill method of production is similar to themithaiwala's method.

How do we produce it by hand? We don't have any forest cultivated forhandmade paper out of bamboo. We go round and collect broken bamboobaskets, old mats, etc- out of waste heaps. It is frequently from rotten thingsthat handmade paper is made.  Take the utilization point of view. Bamboo is produced from the earth. In thecase of the mill, it goes direct from the cultivated soil and comes out as paper.

In the case of the handmade paper we do not cultivate bamboo. It is grownwild in the jungle. These bamboos are brought and baskets, etc. are made outof them. They are used and they last for five to ten years. We have the use ofthe bamboo for all these years. When it gets rotten, it is thrown away. After itis thrown away, we convert it into paper. Which is the better utilization ofresources of these two methods? The second method naturally, because we getseveral years use out of the bamboo and when it becomes useless, we make useof it again for paper. We notice how wasteful it is to make paper by the firstmethod.

In Norway and Sweden they have vast forests and they make paper from woodpulp. In our country this is not possible. In our country, we cannot afford tohave our land put to that kind of use. The bulk of our handmade paper is madeout of waste material. We make paper out of jute. Where does it come from?We do not import it from Eastern Pakistan or any other place like that. We gethold of old gunny bags that have been used, cut them up, boil them withcaustic soda, reduce them to pulp and make paper. Looking at the utilization ofnature’s gift, or production, we see that handmade methods are superior to themethods of mills.

In many respects, handmade things also lead to all round benefit which we donot get from mill-made things. Take, for example, soap. The factories bringcaustic soda from some large chemical companies and with that caustic sodathey mix up oil and by using different processes they manufacture soap. It isnot creation but a transformation of the caustic soda.

We also make cottage soaps. We do not buy any caustic soda. Our boys go afterthe rains, about January or so to fields and collect the Sajjimitti available fromthe surface of the earth. The boys remove this alkaline earth from the surface,which makes the soil better for cultivation. We bring that sediment into ourplace, extract Soda Carbonate and prepare soap out of it adding slaked lime,water etc. We add Ghani oil or such other oil which does not compete with the  people’s food. Our agriculture is the better for this method of soap making andwe utilize oils which are available for purposes other than eating. Thus our soapmaking forms a part of our economic order. Everywhere we have got to link upthese things. Large-scale industries often stand alone and are unrelated to therest of the economic organization.

### POWER

The use of power also may lead towards non-violence or violence, truth oruntruth, according as we resort to current economy or to reservoir economy.

Let us start from the very simplest source; the primary source of powergenerally is man. We have a wealth of man power and that man power must beused as widely as we possibly can. We should try to reduce everything possibleto man power.

In the Punjab there is a great deal of water power, used for grinding cereals.

There is a vessel where the seed is placed. The grinding stone is roated bywater power at night and the atta is ready by the morning. It works practicallywithout any cost. The only cost is that of making the wooden wheel requiredfor the water to rotate the stone. From human power we come to naturalpower, namely water power. We have at our disposal an unending supply ofwater power at a very cheap rate. It can be utilized for making paper pulp,grinding atta or even generating electricity for a limited use.

Large amount of power was generated in the past by the use of wind mills.

There are several such mills even today. It is one method of obtaining power.

Wind mills cost about Rs. 700 or 800 each.

Power costs more as we go further and further from man power. It will not beeasily available for poor people. Monopolies are, therefore, likely to becreated.

We then come from nature to animal power. We have all kinds of animate—bullocks, donkeys, horses, camels, and even elephants—available to people in  India, Thus, we have manpower, water power, wind-mill power, animal power—all are indigenous.

In India our dependence on the bullock power makes dairying an indispensibleindustry, not only for food such as milk, ghee etc., but also for manures andbullocks. We are familiar with the bullock. In Italy too they use bullocks forploughing. In Northern countries they use horses. Horse power has been thecommon, factor even in western countries until recently for ploughing etc. Insandy deserts they use camels. The camel is a very convenient animal becauseof its stupidity. It goes on working once started till it is stopped. Elephants aresources of great power in our country. They are largely used in timber yards.

Elephants can be used for clearing waste lands and jungles and bringing themunder cultivation. Elephants may be used in the place of tractors. They canturn out much of the work that the tractors do. The elephants are almosthuman in their intelligence. But they cannot be kept in areas where there arenot plenty of trees. It would cost about 30 rupees a day to feed an elephant. Ina jungle we can afford to keep them. In such places we can utilize elephantpower as far as available. In Rangoon and Travancore they are using elephantsfor timber lifting. Thus we can make use of these various powers right downfrom doing things with our own hands to the power that elephants provide.

We have got also to see that all things of primary necessities come out of ourown country. Unless we do that there is a tremendous danger of our being lefthigh and dry when the time of conflict comes.

### TRACTORS

There is a great deal of talk about tractor cultivation. If we scrutinise it weshall see the danger. A clever Director of Agriculture was enthusiastic abouttractor cultivation. He wanted to convert all our agriculture into tractorcultivation. Tractors run on petrol or crude oil which are imported stuffs.

Supposing a world war comes on, where from shall we get crude oil or petrol? Itis perilous to depend on imported motive power for our food production.  There is another difficulty with tractors at the present time. Though themachines are available they cannot be serviced. They need a service station. Ifyou want to use them in India, your must have the necessary service stations. Itinvolves a certain stage of development of our economic organization.

Therefore, we must have power according to the nature of the circumstancesunder which we are working.

### ELECTRICITY

We may have even electricity to a certain extent. If we want to use electricitywe have got to be very cautious. We have seen how the electric power used inthe south Arcot district eventually resulted in the water from the villages beingvirtually exported to places like Madras, Bombay, Bangalore and other cities inthe form of fruits and the villagers being left without water. We have to seehow we introduce it and whether its introduction will bring about the welfareof the people or ruin them. If we want to introduce pumps we should do so onlywhere water is available. In the South Arcot district, 94 per cent of the rainfallwent to the sea, and 6 percent only was retained in the ground. By this processof electric pumping, we are reserving that 6 per cent for those who have andare taking it away from those who have not. It is a predatory system ofeconomy; it is pick-pocketing. We tap only the 6 per cent water. Real workmust be to reserve and conserve a large part of the 94 per cent of water whichruns to the sea. We do not worry about it, because conserving would meanirrigation works which would not put money into businessmen’s pockets. Ifelectric pumps etc. are sold, the businessmen get commissions. The realobjective should be to capture the rain and harness it. If the water level can beraised and utilized for irrigation purposes, it is best. If we use it for predatorypurposes, it is immoral and criminal.

We must be able to judge everything on these lines. A certain thing may bevery good in itself but when used in a wrong way it may prove dangers. Therewas a child of 3 years of age. The mother was cooking. The child went to thecupboard and discovered a small bottle. He pulled out the cork and put one pill  out of it into his mouth. It was a sugarcoated pill. Finding the pill sweet thechild went on swallowing the pills one after another till he had swallowedabout 20 pills. They were quinine pills! Soon after the child fell down inconvulsions and before the doctor could be brought, life became extinct.

Similarly power is a dangerous weapon to be put into everybody's hand.

In a certain province the Government wanted to introduce electricity toelectrify the handlooms in village. They did it with the best of intentions.

There were a thousand weavers in the village. After two years of theintroduction of electricity, many weavers had given their profession and othershad left the village. It had brought about the dispersal of the population. Whathad happened was like this. There is a beautiful car, with powerful engine etc.,and by the side there is a bullock- cart with two fine bullocks. What wouldhappen if we take away the two bullocks and transfer and fit the fine engine todrive the bullock cart? The engine can run at 60 miles per hour, but it will notform a combination with the cart.

They were formerly using the handloom for the manufacture of sarees andproduced a saree a week. They may make 50 sarees a year. Each saree wouldcost Rs. 50/-or so. Each weaver required a certain amount of capital to buy thenecessary silk yarn to make the sarees. The sarres were manufactured for themarriage season. During the marriage season everything would be sold out.

When they electrified the looms competition began amongst the weavers. Eachone began to manufacture in large quantities say about 200 sarees. They had todispose of them. The market had not expanded 200 times as the marriageseason could not also be increased 200 times! These sarees were manufacturedin large quantities and were sold at cheap rates to merchants and financiers.

The weavers spent away the money and for a major portion of the yearafterwards they had absolutely nothing to do. A great many became labourers.

That is what had happened by electrification of hand-looms. It only broughtdestruction to many. People's understanding of their resources and getting usedto a certain sense of speed are necessary developments and prerequisites ifpower is to be used. We are unable to adjust ourselves to the great speed  which leads to financial and nervous breakdown. We have got to considerwhether a life of this tremendous pressure is necessary in our land. In our owncountry our needs are few.

A technical school was teaching carpentry. It was fitted with electricmachinery. The manager was proud of the teaching, and his equipment. Thetrainees were all village boys and they were taught to use all those machines.

In the Show Room there were beautiful dressing tables, wardrobes, rose wood,carved work, sandal wood work, etc. The boys did not know even how to usethis type of furniture. There was a very good market for these in England. Thisschool was exploiting child labour for supplying cheap furniture to London. Thestudents in the end did not know how to construct even a bullock-cart. What isthe use of such education.

The boys' education must be co-ordinated to their own life. We ought to makethem resourceful under the conditions of life in which they are going to live.

We have got to be careful that their education is useful to the people in theirown villages. The more we take to mechanical power, the less will it stand us ingood stead in times of necessity.

This is the way things are being done today piecemeal. We are going to build upa wonderful Navy based on petrol and crude oil which fuel we will have to getfrom our enemies! If we have a Navy of gun boats which runs on crude oil and ifa conflict arises with America or England, the oil supply will be cut off. Thesenaval powers are those with whom we may happen to come into conflict. Itwould be folly on our part to expect our enemy power to supply us steel,petrol, etc., to fight them in return. We must base our economic order on suchthings which we ourselves possess and use them in such a mariner as wouldbenefit us in the long run.

### PUBLIC UTILITIES

Are telegraphs, telephones, aero planes and other amenities essential? Therailways have not been an unmixed blessing. It is doubtful if they have been  even a mixed blessing. They have been largely responsible for creatingfamines. When we analyse the evils that have been caused by railways we shallfind that the famines have been increasing considerably within the railway era.

Formerly in villages two or three years' paddy used to be kept before anythingwas sent to the market. When the railways came, they drained away all thesereserves and hence the present famines are artificial ones.- In the old days,they were due to natural causes such as failure of rains. Today they are due toconditions made by man, especially by the instrumentality of the railways.

Railways have been instrumental in converting our country into a raw materialproducing country. If we want to have such means of transport, have them byall means. But they must be worked under proper safeguards.

Certain things may be used, but used like poison, under control and in thehands of specialists. Key industries and large-scale industries, must be underthe control of the Government. By and large, the people should use indigenouspower that is easily available to them. When electricity is available everywhereand we have got adjusted to the tempo of that kind of activity then we may useit. But when we are not adjusted to it, we may suffer from it.

The question whether to use power or not must be taken in conjunction -withthe local circumstances. It is very difficult to lay a hard and fast rule in allthese matters. We must not be enamored of high power machines. The dangercomes when we forget the circumstances prevailing [n the country. If thebenefit is not available to everyone in the country, it would lead to a conditionin which partial monopolies will result.

### DIFFUSION

At the moment there is a great interest evinced in the way Japan is usingpower. The system is claimed to be one of decentralization. It is reallydiffusion of production. Instead of being concentrated in towns, it is diffusedall over. There is a greater exploitation of human beings than in the citycentered production. It is a subtle way of exploitation we are not sure whetherwe shall be able to stand it in India. There are possibilities of greater  exploitation by diffusion of the centers than under concentrated production,When industries are diffused we are not aware of their actual conditions ofworking and believe that they are independent producers. To produce amarketable article the workers are dependent on some central organization.

They will not be able to be independent at any time; the whole economy iscentred on the material production rather on human welfare.

Whether we use power or not, will ultimately depend on these variousconsiderations. We have studied briefly the question—whether to use powerand if so, what sort of power to use, and have seen in what cases power will bebeneficial and in what cases power may be harmful to us. Tractors, petrol etc.,being of the reservoir economy, will lead to violence in the end.

The bullock, cow, horse etc., give us power and also manure. A man had200 acres of land. One tractor salesman who had a tractor of 200 horse powerwith him wanted to show the landowner of 200 acres how a tractor couldplough the land in a few days. He said he would get the land ploughed in ashort time, and after the land had been ploughed he came and told the farmerthat the land had been completely ploughed and wanted him to see it forhimself. The man went and saw and asked him where he had put the 200 horsesdung! The tractor was of 200 horse power and, therefore, there should be dungof 200 horses. Then he said he wanted, not only the ploughing of the land, butalso manure. Our cattle are fertilizing factories as well as power generatingunits. We cannot get things piecemeal like power from one place, manure fromanother place, etc. We have got to organize our economy all round. Only thenit could be called a system. It is a misnomer to call the Western economy asystematic organization, because it is all piecemeal. The various units of theeconomy must be coordinated.

Great Britain came in for a terrible crisis in 1940-41 because she was dependenton foreign countries for food. In that little island there may be an excuse forhaving this kind of organization as it is a small country. Most things they have toget from outside. The things they have there are coal, iron and steel, and they  cannot live on them, and, therefore, they may be dependent on othercountries.

We are thinking in terms of our own country, which is a vast country withvarious resources available, and, therefore, there is no excuse on our part tobring in things from outside when we can develop them ourselves. From ourown resources we can produce almost everything. There is no such thing aswaste at all, one dovetails into the other. What is waste in one case becomesraw material in the second. We must develop our economy on that basis and itis possible in India, though it may not be possible in other countries.

Industrialization may be wasteful under the conditions under which we areplaced.

### WORK

All actions have their reactions. We must not think in terms of materialproducts, only. Work is a thing which has to be analysed and the good it, bringsus ascertained. If it does not do us any good, we need not work at all. In theBible it was said—"By the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.” Man says thathe would not sweat but at the same time eat. ‘He makes somebody else sweatand he eats.

Work has two constituents—the disciplinary part and the creative or pleasurablepart. The great Empires of Babylon etc. deprived man of his primary possession,namely freedom. They made the slaves sweat and the slave owners enjoyed thefruits of that labour. The work part of it the slaves did and the pleasurable partthe lords enjoyed. What was the result? A person requires exercise to keep hisbody fit. Similarly also all works give us exercise for various faculties todevelop. If we take away all work—the disciplinary aspect—man willdeteriorate. The old civilizations died out because men did not work andculturally deteriorated. If we separate the disciplinary side and the culturalside, we shall deteriorate. The slaves deteriorated because they drudged allthe time and the lords deteriorated because they did only the enjoying part of  it. The two things should go together. All work or all play is not good foranybody.

Under the old feudal system the lords lived in the castles and the serfscultivated the soil. That system also has crumbled in course of time.

They devised another method of bringing slavery through the possession orcontrol of instruments of production. We have the capitalistic system. On topof this we have, even to this day, the position of whole nations held underslavery, politically. This is called imperialism. The slave or colonial constituentsproduce raw materials, while the empire country enjoys a higher standard ofliving. This also ultimately spells destruction.

England today is in the dark ages. Although materially during the Victorianperiod she might be said to have had a fair amount of prosperity, culturally itwas the darkest age. In literature, music, art, architecture etc., England's bestperiod was during the Elizabethan period which the British called dark ages. Asindustries came on, its culture went down and when culture went down, itdeteriorated into a third Tate power. In the Victorian age she continued to be apowerful factor because of her previous foundations.

### DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY

Prof. Cyril Burt, a great psychologist, specialized in intelligence tests, says thatthe research that he has carried on during the last 40 years indicates thatEngland is deteriorating at an alarming rate according to intelligence testscarried out on the younger people. This is understandable from our point ofview. The more we depend on industries the less are the chances for thepeople to develop.

The reaction of industrialization on man is not conducive to his growth. At ashoe factory in Northampton which is a great shoe-making centre a psychologistwas in charge of the personnel. The factory was making men's shoes. There wasan old man who did nothing else but cutting heels to shape. This he had donefor 37 years. He was not even an expert shoemaker after all that time. All the  37 years he had not seen the whole factory. How very destructive is thismethod to human beings? We are a bundle of nerves. We have to study, work,play, laugh, etc. for our growth. Work is to our higher faculties what food is tothe physical body. The occupation we follow should contribute towards thegrowth of our personality.

Modern countries, like America, which have studied these things carefully arealso providing for laughter! The Americans in their own way have a separatetime for laughter. In their amusement parks there is a place where all thechairs are electrified. When people sit on them and the switch is on, the chairsbang against each other and then there is a peal of laughter from theoccupants. After a hard day's labour when nerves are frayed, they relax likethis. This is their system of division of labour.

If we project this approach to work into dietetics what will happen? Thedifferent things that are needed for eating are purchased, and cooked andserved. Our own method of eating is to put the different items of food in theleaf and eat them. According to the division of labour of centralized industries,it would need specialization. It would require one person to drink all the ghee,one person to eat all the rice, etc. Each man will do only one specified process.

The result of such a division of labour in dietetics will be that all the partakerswill die. The method is. Totally unsuited for human beings.

In decentralized industries it is different. There was a school master who wasgetting Rs. 40/- per mensem and he was making caps to supplement hisincome. He was asked to demonstrate cap making. He brought his work basket.

There was some plush like cloth. This was obtained from Italy. Another Satinlike cloth he bought from Japan. Some eyelets were from Birmingham. He tooksome newspapers and cut them out into electrical shape. He cut out the Satinlooking cloth and worked some designs on the sewing machine. The commercialfaculties of the teacher were at work when he purchased the different articleshe needed for making the cap. Then his economic faculties came into play,then his artistic talents and so on. Meanwhile the child in his back yard cried.

He left everything, criticized his wife roundly and said that when distinguished  visitors had come she should not have allowed the child to cry. Here we notice,was a complete digression and recreation. So the various parts of man got acertain amount of work or expression in different ways including a quarrel withthe wife. This way cottage industry provides scope for all the faculties of man.

Industrialization is not conducive to the growth of the whole man and his fulldevelopment as a personality. Work has its reaction on mind and that is verymuch more important than the material manifestation of work. Our emphasismust be, not on the material things we produce, but on the opportunities tomake people grow. That is the basis of the new system of education thatGandhiji has developed. Gandhiji's scheme of education is based on hisphilosophy of work. The present system of education is to pump informationinto children’s heads. In the final analysis it is not real education. Character isnot developed but persons so educated go about like an encyclopedia of knowledge.

Our standard of living must be one which gives us an opportunity to express thehighest in us, and should not be the result of a multiplicity of wants that arebeing created artificially. This latter does not make for a higher standard ofliving. It is a misnomer to call multiplicity of wants a high standard of living.

Compare Churchill and Gandhiji. Gandhiji had certain values. His thoughts werefixed on higher things. That is the higher standard which distinguishes us fromthe animals. Churchill goes about with a Cigar in his mouth indicating values ofindulgence. That may be a complex standard of living but certainly not a highstandard of living. There is a complex standard and there is a high standard.

Gandhiji's was simple but a high standard, whereas Churchill's is complex but alow standard, comparatively speaking. Service is a higher ideal, while power isa lower one. Working for power is a low standard.

Psychologically the industrialists attempt to make a good market by paradingthis material standard of living. They set before the people a fashion to beblindly followed. The extent to which people follow that fashion, it makes forbusiness. If industrialists can change fashions, new things could be made and agood market is created. Industrialists flourish on the folly of t customers.  Sitting on the floor and eating from the plantain If does not form a lowstandard of living. We do not ha even to wash the plantain leaf; we simplythrow it away. If we eat with forks and spoons it means a good amount of workto clean and wash etc. We are getting more and more complex today. We havegot to make a distinction between what is a higher standard of living and whatis lower standard of living. From this point of view of simple life,industrialization is not necessary for a high standard of life.

We have seen that from the point of view of the method of production,industrialization is wasteful. From the point of view of the growth of humanbeings industrialization is a hindrance. Human beings become mere machines.

The articles that they produce are no often necessary for us. If we do not thinkthat a high standard of living consists in having a multiplicity o wants, thenindustrialization is not called for to promote a high standard of life.

There are certain things for which large-seal industries may be used. We do notadvocate that this should be wiped out altogether. They will be used onlynecessary evils. If we want quick transportation; becomes a necessary evil.

Industrialization is an evil. We may put up with it in certain cases. In our lifewe teal food and also poison. We may have industrialization; we should put theindustrial products in cupboards and label them as poison. Then we shall usethem under proof controls. Large-scale industries must be under state controland not under private ownership and run not for profit but only run on a servicebasis. We organise a system in which there will be room for large-scaleindustries also. We must decide for what things they are necessary. They mustform a controlled section of our economic order, while small-scale industriesare left free, just as staple foods, are not to be normally under controls, whilemedicines, especially poisonous ones, have to be. In the industrial sector of oureconomic order, we have to put large-scale industry in juxtaposition, andcentralized industries should be used only wherever necessary. They should beused for a certain restricted purpose, and not for making money by individualsand flooding the country with unnecessary things.
