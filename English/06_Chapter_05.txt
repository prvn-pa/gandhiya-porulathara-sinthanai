## CHAPTER 5

### SOCIALISM, COMMUNISM AND GANDHIAN ECONOMY

Many of these ‘isms’ are forms of organizations meant for common good. At itsbest and when superficially looked at Communism does not appear to aim atanything less than what Gandhism does. But there is a world of difference inthe means. On the material level there might not be much apparent difference,but we must judge not merely from the material level, but also from the moral,the spiritual and the social level. On the material and on the social level theymay appear almost equal. When we come to the application of moral andspiritual values, we begin to bifurcate. Even at the social level, they are notquite equal. Socialism and Communism think of the nation as one unit, India'strade is not one unit. It is made up of Birlas, Tatas, Dalmias and aninnumerable number of other such persons. When we talk in terms of Indiantrade or Indian wealth, we are not referring to homogeneous things. We areconcerned with individuals and not India as a whole. There is no such thing asIndia apart from the human beings composing it. There are human being also inAmerica, in England and in every other country. Our outlook must be universal.

There is a great deal of difference in this between Gandhism and Socialism.

While in England, even Indians must eat the food that is grown there, becausewe plead for self-sufficiency. It makes little difference whether it is India orEngland. Imported food we should not eat; as political frontiers lead toconflicts foreign trade is often based on violence. We are human beings and notideological units. Our attitude is not one of nationalism. The group has noexistence without the units, In that way socialism is somewhat circumscribedand communism too. They have a certain limited ideology.

Gandhism aims at the development of the human being. It does not matter howmany chairs and tables we have got in our house. Communism emphasises thematerial welfare at all costs. Other human beings may be subjugated. StateSocialism looks upon all human beings as only living for the State, while underthe Gandhian conception State is an instrument for the benefit of every  individual. He should develop spiritually, morally and economically. In so far aswe are aiming at material welfare, there can be no difference betweencommunism and socialism and Gandhism. The difference comes where weinfuse moral values. As an individual every person has a moral responsibility.

When a social plan appeals to our higher nature and to our conception ofspiritual and moral standards, it is all right. If it does not, we may withdraw.

That is where non-co-operation fits in.

But in Socialism or Communism we have got to do and toe the line that isplaced before us. The State or the Society is supreme. In our case theindividuals are spiritual beings and the State is there to help to realize theindividual's personality. The emphasis we lay is primarily moral and spiritual.

Even if our material welfare is not catered for, it does not matter. Even bicycleriding may be an act that supports warfare. The armament factories are runduring war time, to make tanks and other armaments and munitions. Whenthey are not so engaged during the so-called peace time, the machinery wouldbecome rusted. So at such times, they make only a certain amount ofarmaments and are otherwise utilised in producing something for the market.

They turn their attention to supplying other universal wants e.G., bicycle. When we buy a Rs. 200/- worth B.S.A. bicycle, we are paying part of the warexpenses to keep that armament factory going. That is a consideration underGandhism, but not under Socialism or Communism.

### REGIMENTATION

In the Gandhian order of things there is room also for some regimentation.

Gandhiji wants everybody to spin; there is regimentation; but it is voluntary.

We spin one hour every day as part of our discipline. That is active cooperation,with the ideal that is set before us.

Under Socialism they may want to socialise large-scale industries. There, as wehave seen, men are made part of the machine so that production may be keptup. They want to reckon in terms of material results. Gandhiji's ideal is tocalculate in terms of individual expression. Some persons may be of a higher  type and some of the lower. If the person is of a higher quality, he should helpthe men in the lower stages. We have to count ourselves as one family. There isneither white, black nor brown; neither Chinese, nor Japanese. Theseconsiderations do not come in. It is not because an article is produced by Japanthat we do not want to use it. In the case of the widespread boycott after theBengal partition, we boycotted all things that were British. That boycott maybe all right under socialism or communism. That was founded on hatred andwas basically political. Ultimately it will lead to violence. Under the Gandhianorder, if we refrain from using a foreign article it is because we do not knowanything of the article and cannot assess its value and the conditions underwhich it was produced so far away. If we burn kerosene oil we become a partyto Burmese slavery, as Burma, where the oil comes from, was subjugated toexploit her resources. Such boycott is non-violent. We may call it non-violentSwadeshi spirit. After the Bengal partition Swadeshi was violent Swadeshi. TheGandhian programme which refrains from getting foreign goods is non-violentSwadeshi.

In this way in every act of ours we shall notice that the considerations thatweigh are moral and spiritual as against purely material or political; and wemust refrain from those that will ultimately lead to war based on hatred, greedand jealousy.

There is a big difference in the organization of the Socialist State, theCommunist State and the Gandhian State at that plane where moralconsiderations come in. In the case of organizations also there is somedifference. There is difference in the way in which we are trying to work it. Ifone wants to have centralised methods of production, one should be preparedfor regimentation which contributes to a mentality conducive to dictatorship."Ours is not to reason why; ours is but to do and die.” In the Gandhian economy,each man is responsible to his own God. If we do that, we must depend on theInner Voice. Through self-discipline and self-control we should develop thepower of discerning right from then comes Civil Disobedience. The mind shouldbe prepared to take the consequences of that Disobedience. Gandhian economy  is based on moral and spiritual forces. Each individual is supreme; eachindividual is considered a potentially divine person; each individual representsthat which is immortal in man. Otherwise we are no better than a Zoo. We riseabove the animal kingdom in so far only as we develop our higher self. Whenthe economic and social organisations are so tuned as to encourage individualdevelopment and expression, we have what may be called the Gandhian Socialorder. Herein lies the difference between communism, socialism andGandhism.

In the lower levels of material considerations also there is some difference.

Ultimately the material welfare of the whole society too is our concern. Itmakes a big difference when society is viewed as composed of individuals in theGandhian ideal. Society is looked upon as an aggregate made up of individualscontributing to make such a society. In socialism individual development is notnecessarily the objective. It may be even definitely against such an end.

### GANDHIAN ECONOMY

Here is a picture of Gandhian Society. The organization will be one whichproduces all that is necessary with the co-operation of the people around fortheir primary needs, viz., food, clothing, shelter, education of a type and otherpublic utilitizes brought about by the method of decentralized control. Thegreater the control, the less is its approach to the Gandhian ideal. This wouldlead to chaos, if the ideal of self-control and self-discipline were not there. Forinstance, we have a blue print for construction of buildings. We see a mason isworking by himself in the corner. Yet it is not chaos. Because the architect hasplanned where the different buildings, should be put up. Each group works outthe print into details. That controlling plan in life is the achievement of non-violence and truth. There cannot be chaos because they are eternal principles.

They had no beginning and they will be there tomorrow when we are all gone.

In an universal principle there can be no chaos. Each man is connected up withthe power that is generated. In Calcutta, Madras and Bombay we have electrictramways. They are controlled in two ways. As long as they are on the rails  below and connected with the livewire above, they cannot deviate from thepath. The moment they deviate, the connection goes off. As long as we are intouch with the Eternal Power on the one side and the track below, there can beno chaos. With self-control and self-discipline we cannot go wrong any morethan a mason goes wrong in building, as long as he follows closely the blue printprovided by the architect. His relationship is to the Master mind and the Masterbuilder. Whatever our plan may be, if we direct it towards the achievement ofnonviolence and truth, which is the main plan, through self- control and self-discipline, just like the rails below, we shall attain unity of action andconformity with the rest of society. Chaos will come in if individuals are notqualified and equipped with these underlying requirements. In Gandhiansociety, therefore, there is full scope for each individual to express himself andyet sterilize the possible danger of chaos.

Now, on this basis we can lay down a plan for group action. The first thing weneed is food. We must organize ourselves for production of food on a co-operative basis. We should know what we want. There is a certain thing calledbalanced diet. It is not merely taking cereals but it aims at balancing it withother items also. In addition to wheat we must have a little fat. We alsorequire a certain amount of minerals. But there is very little mineral in cereals.

To compensate that small quantity, we use vegetables and fruits. We shall havewheat as the staple food, balanced with ghee, fruits, vegetables and otheritems of that nature. Supposing we want to have a balanced diet for 6000persons. We have the menu; we would require 6000 lbs. of wheat if we allow 6ounces a person. Similarly we calculate all other requirements. Having takenthe total requirements we plan the amount of acreage that should be placedunder wheat, etc. We would then know how much land is necessary forproducing wheat, dal, etc. We shall need, say, about 12,000 acres. Having gotit, we plough the land. There may be a variety of soil. We produce the thingsneeded by us from the land suited to the crop. It may be that we cannotproduce sufficient cotton in that area. We may produce vegetables, andexchange that surplus with somebody else for another thing which he has grownand which we need but do not have. In this way we have got to plan out our  cultivation. This is called balanced cultivation, referring back to its source,namely, balanced diet. In this manner we shall be able to meet our needswithin our circle, or failing that, with the co-operation of the circle outside.

For this we ought to have the cooperation of everybody. We stop all trading; allproduction from a particular group comes into the common pool—themultipurpose co-operative society. Suppose one requires oil. The surplus ofwheat produced by one will be utilised of supplying the one with oil. The co-operative society will get the oil seeds from farmers who cultivate it. The oilmen do not produce seeds. The co-operative society has the seed and theoilman extracts oil. There is no payment made to the man. The return is not inthe form of any money. The oil goes back to the co-operative society and theoil cake remains with the man. In the past this system of payment was reallyworking well. That system is in existence to this day in some villages.

The whole of the payment was made on this cooperative system of a commonpool and out of the common pool everybody got something for the commonservices they rendered to society—the barber, the scavenger, the dhobie, thevillage sweeper, etc. When the threshing of corn goes on, each village servantincluding the teacher gets his quota distributed from the general pool. He getsit for certain service he renders. In those days we could not have a largenumber of razors. The barber had one razor. It was a specialized service he wasrendering. The blacksmith prepared steel and iron. He prepared also the razor.

If each individual had to have a razor, we shall be wasting iron and steel. In ourold organization we had the village servants who got their quota, or minimumwage, out of the common pool for the services they rendered. The cobblerprepared one pair of chappals every year for each of the village people. Thechamar gave one mote to each farmer. If anyone wanted an extra chappal, hewill have to pay for it separately. Each village servant's maintenance was takencare of out of the common pool. Today we have the Multipurpose Co-operativeSociety which can be really the economic centre which can organize theplanning for the whole community. We see how the economic organization canallow for the production of all necessary things.  If we have a group working, in an organization of 25,000 persons there will bespecialists such as engineers etc. In our old organization we had irrigationprojects. The irrigation method guaranteed a certain amount of fertility to thesoil. There was what was known as the double tank system. There is first asmall tank. The small tank receives the water first. The water comes in withsediment and it precipitates more on less all the sediment in the first tank andthen the clear water runs over to the bigger tank. The second tank is the onewhere the water is stored, and it is used for irrigating the fields through canals.

The silt is the first tank becomes the property of certain farmers, who keep itfully dredged while taking out their own share of the deposited silt. The secondtank does not get silted and, therefore, water accumulates there to a largeextent. Here is both service and self- interest jointly working together for thecommon good. We are rendering a service to the community by keeping theirrigation tank from getting silted over. That is nature's way of giving wages.

Supposing there is a picnic. The members eat and throw away the crumbs. Halfa dozen crows come and eat them away and keep the place clean. There is‘'work and wages' connected with it. Ants come and eat the sugar that is spiltover. Our old organization was based on the system where money wages werenot given separately. These are the principles on which we should re-build oursociety. We should study the conditions and the advantages in that civilizationwe had enjoyed once. We are becoming more and more barbarians.

In our re-organized society we want to introduce those social principles. If wewant water to run in one direction all that we have to do is to see that thelevel of the flow of water is regulated. We have got to arrange our social orderin such a way that every one while working for his own interest works also forSociety. Our Panchayats should really be trained for general service. There maybe one Panchayat for a group of 20 or 30 villages. We take the villagers at theTehsil level, then advance to the District level and then to the Provincial leveland then to the Central level. Only then can we develop a nationalgovernment. Men trained in running their own affairs will proceed, according totheir qualifications further and further until they reach the top. We had ancientkingdoms run on these lines. We should read history in this light and not  memorize dates and other details. We must study these things and translatethem into action in our lives.

Our needs will not be properly attended to until we galvanise the necessarytalent and bring it to bear on the needs of the whole nation. That is our generalpicture of the outline plan of the villages, and a conception of how we wantthe economic, the social and the national organisation to be built up based onthe character of the people on the basis of service and a sense of duty, movingtowards the progressive attainment of nonviolence and truth in human society.
