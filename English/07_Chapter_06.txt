## CHAPTER 6

### CONCLUSION

In the preceding chapters we have seen that the objective of all human activityis not merely on the material level but has an enormous bearing on our socialorder and culture through the development of individual personality. We worktowards bringing into being a civilization that will not depend on theexploitation of our fellowmen and at that cost afford a high standard ofmaterial living to a few. If the Gandhian ideology prevails it should result in afairly even standard of material comforts for everybody and bring about a typeof civilization where there will be no need for periodic wars as at present.

Let us hope that the day will soon dawn that Tolstoy was looking forward to,when the people, weary of all the meaningless misery and bloodshed, will sayto their leaders, "Go from us, put on the bloody uniforms yourselves and killyour own kind—It matters not to us whether we are considered a great or smallpeople all that matters to us is that we should enjoy, undisturbed, the fruits ofour toil—and all peace loving people should be permitted to develop their livesin mutual harmony and understanding.”

This is not an impossible ‘heaven on earth' that we are seeking. Humanity isbeing driven by force of circumstances towards self-sufficiency in food andprimary needs. If this tendency is resisted persistently the other alternative isthe wiping out of the human race by competitive armament and progressivedestruction and annihilation of one nation by another. Will man have theforesight to choose the right path?

The way indicated by Gandhiji is not one which only the few great persons canfollow. It is so simple that the humblest citizen amongst us can adopt. Itconsists in leading our own individual lives according to the dictates of thatwhich is highest in us. It, of course, means self- control and self-disciplineinstead of self-indulgence as at present. We have to set up a code of action ora standard of values based on social, moral and spiritual considerations. This  will be the only way that can usher in Ram Rajya for all people and bring peaceand true prosperity for every individual.
